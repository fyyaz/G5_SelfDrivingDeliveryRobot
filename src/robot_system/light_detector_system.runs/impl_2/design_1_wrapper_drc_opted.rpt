2. REPORT DETAILS

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_0_pin1_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_0_pin1_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_0_pin2_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_0_pin2_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_0_pin3_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_0_pin3_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#4 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_1_pin1_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_1_pin1_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#5 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_1_pin2_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_1_pin2_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#6 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Pmod_out_1_pin3_iobuf/IBUF (in Pmod_out_1_pin3_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg input design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg input design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg multiplier stage design_1_i/light_detect_sys/light_detect_0/inst/light_detect_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_detect/w_acc_x_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	OV7670_PCLK_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to F16
	OV7670_PCLK_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port OV7670_SIOD expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
